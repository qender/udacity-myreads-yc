# MyReads Project

This is my submission for the final project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.


## How to run

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Backend Server

Udacity's provided backend server is used for this project. [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) was used to perform the required operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Search Results
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
